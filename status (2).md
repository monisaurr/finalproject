#### What have you done for your project so far?

I played around with pygame and was figuring out how to actually start the code (figuring out if I should use turtle, how to get a background, etc)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't figured out how to make the target disappear after shooting it, how to add recoil, how to make the target appear at a random place.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I made stupid mistakes like forgetting to capitalize some code, etc
