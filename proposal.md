# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Target Shooting Practice Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that helps you practice your aim for shooting games 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will have targets on which the player will have to click and the target will move positions. The targets will change in color randomly and when it does, it will require the player to shoot and hold the target until it breaks, but there will also be recoil. I will most likely use python turtle or pygame. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I understand the basics of pygame and know how to incorporate it into my project. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish making the targets break when clicked on and it changes position after.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I make the targets break after it gets clicked on, and I incorporate the LMG with recoil type mode.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to understand how pygame works, I will need to research how to add sound to the game, and maybe even learn how to add recoil.
